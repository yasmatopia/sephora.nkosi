    <h2>About Sephora</h2>
    
    <div class="text-box">
      <p> Sephora N’Kosi (she/they) finds it hard to be contained within the jumble of an 100-word bio. She dances under many hats - such as queer, congolese, poet and designer — but never ceases to prioritize kindness and openness in her work. 
  In her studies at the National Theatre School of Canada for Production Design and Technical Arts, she encourages visceral and honest stories through her writing and designs. 
  At 17, she earned her first Dora Mavor Award nomination with Théâtre Français de Toronto, before going on to write two poetry books the following year. 
  Based in Toronto, she expands her practice as a Technical Director, Lighting Designer and Stage Manager.</p>
